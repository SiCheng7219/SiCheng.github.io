## Short Bio

I'm a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) student at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), where I have had the privilege of receiving an outstanding foundational education in automation and modern control theory. My academic achievements include an impressive **GPA of 3.8**, ranking **5th out of 196 fellow students**, and earning numerous awards in competitions, as well as multiple scholarships and honours.\
\
I'm currently working on my graduation thesis, focusing on the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** and doing research on **robot control and multi-agent decision-making**. Additionally, my research interests extend to **localization**, **complex systems**, and **optimization**. Being scheduled to graduate from BIT in **June 2024**, I'm actively seeking opportunities to pursue an **MPhil or MRes program** and I'm ready to participate in a research project starting in **July 2024**.

*The articles above were written during my participation in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling. In three competitions, I served as the leader for a group of three, responsible for modeling and paper writing. Through this experience, I developed the ability to analyse academic problems in group work, scan previous research, and use basic coding approaches to experiment.*
