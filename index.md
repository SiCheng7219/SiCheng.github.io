*The articles above were written during my participation in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling. In three competitions, I served as the leader for a group of three, responsible for modeling and paper writing. Through this experience, I developed the ability to analyse academic problems in group work, scan previous research, and use basic coding approaches to experiment.*
